<h1>Homework 9: Custom map choropleth </h1>
<h2>Quentin McCalla</h2>
<h3>This map shows a chloropleth of the National Parks in Alaska</h3>
<h4>I chose to do Alaska because with a map of the entire United States it was difficult to see the National Parks 
    and how often they were visited because the parks are so small when compared to the whole country. I chose 
    Alaska because there is a high concentration of parks in 1 state.
